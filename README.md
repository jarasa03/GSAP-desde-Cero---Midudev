# 🌀 GSAP Practice – Midudev Course

This repository is a personal sandbox to practice and explore **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** animations while following the private course [GSAP desde Cero](https://midu.dev/curso/gsap-desde-cero) created by [@midudev](https://github.com/midudev).

## 📚 About the Project

The course focuses on building **incredible animations** for modern web pages using GSAP, with real-world examples inspired by sites like **Linear** and **Apple**. This repository follows the lessons step by step, not just replicating the animations, but experimenting and improving upon them.

## 🚀 Stack

- 🧩 **GSAP (GreenSock)**
- 💡 **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- 🎨 **HTML5 / CSS3**

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

Throughout the project, we'll cover:

- What GSAP is and its advantages
- How to install and configure GSAP
- Creating your first animations and working with properties
- Nesting animations
- Using timelines
- Real-world animation examples
- Integrating and using GSAP plugins

> More lessons will be added as the course progresses.

## 🔧 Setup

You can open the `.html` files directly in your browser, or use a local server if needed (e.g., VSCode **Live Server** extension).
